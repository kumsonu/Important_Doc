Q>> why OSI model.
Q>> OSI layear and it's servies.
Q>> TCP/IP layear and it's servies.
Q>> how device get MAC address.
Q>> if ARP request is broadcast then where we put destination MAC address FFFFFFF.
Q>> Draw back of setting static and manual ip address
ans: it leads to ip address wastage and mobility of node(device)
Q>> where we use static ip address assigment.
Ans:1> server which is accessing from remote because if it is changing the how will you connect.
    2>if network addmin want to track trafic from particular system then it should run at static ip.
Q>> what is RARP.
Ans: reverse of ARP ..it will supply MAC address and get IP address from RARP server.
Q>> why RARP.
Ans: since diskless workstation are having less memory, they can't store the entire OS to boot, so after booting it will connect with RARP
server and get the ip address.
Q>> what is BOOTP.
Ans:-BOOTP is used by diskless workstation, which gather the information(IP address of system) from BOOTP server. 
Q>>how it work.
Ans:- it's work in similar way of DHCP but diffrence is it allocate static IP address and table is similar to DHCP.
Q>> DHCP server IP allocation.
Ans:- using DORA process...it will assign the ip address for some time and befor time get over 
Q>> how you will come to know collision occure.what is CSMA/CD.
Ans if voltage level is raise then we can say collision occure(sudden change in electrical signal).if collision occure in medium that time
device should backoff mean it shouldn't transmit data to medium.it will wait untiil route is clear.time is calculated by backoff
algorithm and CSMA/CD uses backoff algorithm to calculate waiting time.
Q>> how router select best path for any packet.
Ans: Routing protocol running in the router which help to build the routing table and exchange the information.
